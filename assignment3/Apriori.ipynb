    "The above code runs the Apriori algorithm on each qualifying country in the dataset, grouping all products together that were a part of the same transaction. \"Qualifying country\" means that some assumptions about the assignment problem had to be made. Through testing the Apriori algorithm on each of the different countries in the dataset, it was determined that due to the quickly increasing complexity of the algorithm, the association rule generation may take too long ( > 10 minutes) for a country. This was discovered to be the case for some countries that had a low number of total transactions (2 or less). What occured here was that the Apriori algorithm generated a lot of rules with the same statistics (support, confidence and lift) so specifying different hyperparamters would not speed up the generation. So for simplicity, these countries were ignored. Furthermore, this occured for the 'Unspecified' country, so it was filtered out of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "With needing to run the Apriori algorithm on 30+ countries in this dataset, each country was manually tested to find the optimal minimum support threshold, as seen in the \"minsups\" list. This was a list created from manual testing Apriori on each country. This improved the overall efficiency of the program while also finding the top 5 associations for each country. \n",
    "\n",
    "The associations that were found were noticed to have the left hand side of the association being an empty set ([]), with the right hand side being the product description. This means that the association's product description found on the right hand side is commonly found in transactions in general. Also, associations show that both the left and right hand sides contains a list of product descriptions. This means that when the left hand side products are present, the right hand side products are commonly found to be present too (to the degree of statistics of support, confidence and lift).\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding the \"Top 5 Associations\" for each country, each record outputed from the Apriori algorithm was stored and later sorted based on each record's confidence value. This means that each of the 5 associations and their corresponding statistics were those with the top 5 highest confidence values."
