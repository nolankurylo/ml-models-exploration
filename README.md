# Machine Learning Models Exploration - SENG 474 Dating Mining

This repository contains assignments from my SENG 474 technical elective that cover common machine learning algorithms. These
algorithms were programmed using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn alongside various implementations
from scratch. While this repository outlines required assignments, it also demonstrates my experience and understanding of many 
machine learning applications written in clean, well-documented code.
